_Not to be confused with [Mike Macgirvin](http://zothub.com/channel/mike), who is totally the opposite of ugly._

This is an absurdist game being made using the [Ren'Py Visual Novel Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%27Py). It is licensed under the [GNU GPL v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), and all artistic assets included will be [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). This project is an experiment in pursuing one of my long-ignored passions, which is game development. Admittedly, this is more of a visual novel than anything else, so most of the gameplay will involve dialogue, stat-building, and very basic puzzles.

## The Story

Ugly Mike lives in a [crapsack world](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrapsackWorld) populated by deformed mutants with diminished intelligence. Something got into the water a long time ago, affecting absolutely everyone living in the area. The damaage is now completely irreversable, and enough time has gone on that no one remembers a time before this. Now, the inhabitants struggle to read and perform basic mathematics.

Ugly Mike longs for the sensual touch of a maiden, and ventures out of his underground cave to find love.
